Welcome to me new blog.. again..

I'm convinced I'm the absolute worst person at being happy with how my site look... I guess style changes all the time. 

*So what's new?*

I got rid of Wordpress.. Sorry Matt.
I just needed something a bit simpler and more importantly, something I could maintain my blog via GIT. Yes GIT! 
I'm a huge fan of git. 
It just feels like I have so much more control over what's happening on my site.

I will be doing my best to update this as frequently as possible.. I haven't really written in over a year so I guess this is gonna be a challenge. 

But hey, its 2018 LETS DO THIS!!

Peace
